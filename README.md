# Pokemon Trainer Club Account Creator

Still a work in progress, hopefully this will automate some of the boring stuff for people who want to create mass accounts for use with pokemon go mapping applications

##Installation:

**Note:** Python 2.7

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Gee19/ptcreate.git`
2. Install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit globals (acc_prefix, password, num_of_acc, last_acc_suffix) in main.py (will move to config file soon)
3. Start by running `python main.py`

##TODO
- **Add guerilla mail integration**
- Build dict of created accounts
- Output to json for use with pokemon go mapping apps 
- Lots more >.<
